# Crowdfunding-ETL



##  Summary

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

The purpose of this project was to combine several CSV to make it easier to read the overabundance of information. In the original CSV files, all the data was contained within one column. I separated the data into their own rows to further break down the information for easy look-up.  

ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)

Created a relationship model to determine what information overlapped between the CSV files before I started combining the data so duplicates were not created.
